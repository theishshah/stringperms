# StringPerms

## Info
Language Chosen: Java
Libraries Imported: Scanner, Set, HashSet
Complexity: N! (Number of Permutations given N characters)

Source code: stringperms/javaperm/src/com/ish/Main.java

## Usage
Either build/run Main.java from any IDE or execute the .jar
Commandline Java interface to print out all unique permutations of a string.
Type 'quit' to exit the app. Currently unable to give permutations of 'quit' for this reason

## Problem Statement 
In a language of your choice, write a command line utility that given a string as an input will print out all unique permutations of that string. Example inputs to consider are "aaa", "cake", and "banana".

Please include a means of building and/or packaging your utility for distribution to other systems using whatever build technologies that work for you and/or the language you've chosen.
